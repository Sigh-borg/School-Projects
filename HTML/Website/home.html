            <img class = "profile-image" src = "images/Profilepic.jpg" \>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I am a sophmore student at the College DuPage. I am enrolled in the Engineering Pathways Program, 
                which is a partnership program between UIUC and College of DuPage that gurantees admission into 
                the Grainger College of Engineering upon completion. I am currently and have taken multiple coding classes
                alongside my general STEM courses to further my capabilities in understanding programming.
            </p>
            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a part of the Robotics Club, Engineering and Technology Club, the Computer Science Club, and the Math Club.
                This year, I am mainly focusing on learning AI and refining my C++ skills in the Robotics Club and Computer Science Club. 
                In Robotics, I will be responsible for aiding in the development of the autonomous detection system for the robot designed
                for a Lunabotics competition. This will involve the usage of C++, Robotics Operating System (ROS), and Linux.
                In CS Club, I will be studying TensorFlow to further my endeavors, which is an open-source library for machine learning
                applications.
            </p>
            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Linux OS</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My initial interest in artificial intelligence is in great relation to my interest in chess. AI piqued my interest when
                Google's Alpha Zero AI chess program had solid winrates against the current top chess engines. These chess engines are what
                every chess grandmaster around the world uses to refine their play, and Alpha Zero essentially broke this standard.
                Alpha Zero had demonstrated to me the potential that AI could bring to problem-solving and learning in general. 
                Outside of CS and chess, I also enjoy to play table tennis and video games. 
            </p>
